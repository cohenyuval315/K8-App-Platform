## Overview

Pymicroservicesbase is a modular and configurable microservices architecture that I‚Äôve been building in my free time. It‚Äôs not perfect, and some parts are still a work-in-progress, but it‚Äôs a project I‚Äôve enjoyed working on to learn, experiment, and improve my skills. This architecture is designed to be flexible, and while it‚Äôs functional, it‚Äôs primarily a demo and learning experience for now.

The project demonstrates the use of modular microservices, an API Gateway, and an SDK to handle various tasks. it‚Äôs a fun and ongoing exploration of building distributed systems.

## Introduction

This microservices architecture provides a foundation for building highly decoupled, generic microservices that are flexible to integrate into any type of system, while maintaining a strict scope of responsibility per service. Built with Python for fast development, it uses a sdks to share common building blocks across services.


## Services Overview


### Service Structure: (Domain Driven Design):
```
  /{{service}}/                   # Root directory for the service
      /api/                       # Contains internal API definitions and configurations
          /controllers/           # Functions that handle API request processing with dependency injection
          /routes/                # All route definitions for the API

      /application/               # Contains interfaces and application-specific logic
          /commands/              # Defines actions to be performed with their respective interfaces
          ...

      /domain/                    # Contains core business logic for the service
          /{{service}}/           # Service-specific domain models and business logic
          ...                      # Other business-related components

  app.py                          # Main application entry point
  logger.py                       # Logging utility for the service
  README.md                       # Documentation for the service
```


### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **User Service**



The **User Service**  is designed to handle all user-related operations, providing endpoints for retrieving, creating, managing, and deleting users. For more details, refer to the [User Service Documentation](pymicroservicesbase/services/authentication_service/README.md).


---

### ü™™ **Authentication Service**

The Authentication Service is responsible for handling user authentication. It provides mechanisms for verifying user identity but does not manage access permissions. For more details, refer to the .
[Authentication Service Documentation](pymicroservicesbase/services/authentication_service/README.md)


### üåê **API Gateway Service**

The **API Gateway Service**  acts as an internal service that serves as a single entry point for all requests, routing traffic to the appropriate microservice, while it centralizing key functions. For more details, refer to the [API Gateway Service Documentation](pymicroservicesbase/services/api_gateway_service/README.md).

## SDKs:

### web api
The Web API is built using FastAPI and designed to be a unified service builder, offering easily extendable features and ready-to-use build variants. Adhering to the latest best practices, PEP standards, and utilizing a well-structured `pyproject.toml`, this setup streamlines the Web API build process with many configurable options for seamless integration.

### SQL:
The SQL Delegator handles the main database operations and provides a single entry point for these tasks. It is designed to follow best practices for reliable and efficient database interaction.
- Built in alignment with SQLAlchemy documentation and best practices.
- Ensures no race conditions during database operations.
-  Utilizes asynchronous session context variables for improved performance.
- Flexible design, making it suitable for use in various contexts.
- Robust transaction management for maintaining data consistency.


### Cache
A comprehensive structure for managing all caching operations, designed to decouple the caching logic from the specific cache service being used. Includes thorough test coverage to ensure reliability.


### Service Internal
A singleton connection pool using an httpx asynchronous client, designed to handle direct communication with other microservices. It also includes ready-to-use clients for common microservices.


# Demo Product
Essentially an admin dashboard, this project does not require a specialized backend. It is built with the latest technologies, including Next.js with the App Router and TypeScript. Features include user sessions, data management, and server-side rendering.
