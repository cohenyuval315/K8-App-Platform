# Private Folder - Secure Files

## Overview

The **Private Folder** contains sensitive files that are crucial for the secure operation of the system. These files are used for cryptographic operations, secure communications, and other security-related tasks. Access to these files is restricted and should be handled with care.

### Contents of the Private Folder

This folder includes the following important security-related files:

- **.gnupg**: A directory containing GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard) configuration files. These files are used to manage encryption keys and handle secure communication.
- **private-key.asc**: This file contains a private cryptographic key in ASCII armored format. It is essential for performing decryption and signing operations. **This key must be kept secure** and never exposed publicly.
- **cert.perm**: A file containing security certificates. These are used for secure communication between services, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- **key.pem**: This is a private key in PEM format. It is used for secure connections and encryption/decryption operations.

### Security Notice

- These files contain **critical secrets** and are integral to maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
- **Never share** these files with unauthorized users or expose them to public repositories.
- It is essential that **only authorized personnel** have access to this folder.
- Make sure to handle these files in compliance with your organization's security policies.

### How to Use These Files

- **GnuPG**: Use the files in the `.gnupg` folder with GnuPG tools for encrypting and signing messages and files.
- **Private Key**: The `private-key.asc` is used in conjunction with its public key counterpart for secure encryption/decryption processes.
- **Certificates and Keys**: The `cert.perm` and `key.pem` files are typically used for securing web services, APIs, or communication protocols requiring encryption.

### Important Notes

- Ensure that these files are stored securely and are backed up as needed in accordance with your organization's disaster recovery plans.
- If you suspect that any of these files have been compromised, take immediate action to revoke the keys, regenerate them, and ensure proper security measures are in place.
